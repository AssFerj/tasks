# Task Management Web App

This is a web application for task management that allows users to create, list, edit, and delete tasks. The frontend is developed using React.js, React Router DOM for route management, and TypeScript. The backend is built with Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify, and Prisma ORM. The backend supports user creation, listing, and searching for a user by email. The API uses authentication using JSON Web Token and encryption with bcrypt. The project uses a non-relational database (MongoDB).
